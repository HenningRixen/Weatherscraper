# Weatherscraper

Trying to build a Scraper who tells me ecatly which weather we get next week, and what the lowest temperature in the night is.
Because i want to use it for my garden so i can see if i can put my plants out or not.
Trying to crwal multiple weather sites to get a based output. 

Maybe adding: 
humidity
sun hours for south east (my window)
